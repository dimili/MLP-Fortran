To use a makefile to compile your input files, use the nmake command. For example, if your project is your_project.mak:

nmake /f your_project.mak FPP=ifort.exe LINK32=xilink.exe

The arguments of this nmake command are as follows:

/f
 A particular makefile.
 
your_project.mak
 A makefile you want to use to generate object and executable files.
 
FPP
 The compiler-invoking command you want to use. The name of this macro might be different for your makefile. This command invokes the preprocessor.
 
LINK32
 The linker you want to use.
 

The nmake command creates object files (.obj) and executable files (.exe) specified in your_project.mak file.
